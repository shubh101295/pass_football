# pass_football
First 2D game developed  by me

It is a game written in Lua and it uses Love 2D game Engine.
Firstly set up Love 2D on your machine then inside the folder pass-football run

`love football11.love`

In this game each of the two teams have two players each. 
On the top of the screen you can see whether the mode is pause/play. Intially the game mode is set to pause , you can change it by pressing `enter` key on the keyboard.
Then the mode will change to play and the player starts.
The teamA can move the player by using `WASD` keyworks on keyboard.
the teamB can move the player by using the `arrow keys` on the keyboard.
TeamA can change the player by pressing `Q` button.
TeamB can change the player by pressing `L` button.
Unfortunately only one player per team can move at a time.
The left and the right boundary line of the fields are the goal and it is the whole left and right line.
Whenever ball reaches there the positions of each player becomes the same as the starting position and the score of the teams are changed accordingly.
The game is again in the pause mode , press `enter` to get into play mode .
